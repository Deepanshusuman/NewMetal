# NewMetal: Experimental Alloy Design Toolkit

**NewMetal** is a research-oriented toolkit for designing, simulating, and documenting custom metallic alloys. The goal is to simplify experimentation with metal compositions and properties for material scientists, researchers, and hobbyists.

## 🔬 Features

- 🔧 Define base metal compositions
- 🧪 Simulate alloy formation and cooling
- 📊 Log physical properties: strength, hardness, conductivity, etc.
- 🌡️ Temperature-based behavior tracking
- 📁 Export alloy recipes and test results

## 🧰 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy
- Pandas

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
